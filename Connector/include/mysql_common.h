  On Windows, MSVC issues warnings if public API class definition uses
  another class which is not exported as public API (either as a base class
  or type of member). This is indeed dangerous because client code might get
  the class definition wrong if the non-exported component is not available or
  (worse) is defined in a different way than the same component during connector
  build time.

  We can not completely avoid these warnings because for some API classes we
  use standard C++ library classes as components. For example, we use
  std::shared_ptr<> a lot. We can not modify standard library headers to export
  these classes. As is the common practice, we ignore this issue assuming that
  the code that uses our connector is built with the same C++ runtime
  implementation as the one used to build the connector. To silence the warnings,
  uses of standard library classes in our public API classes should be surrounded
  with DLL_WARNINGS_PUSH/POP macros.

  Macro to put at the end of other macros that define lists of items. This is
