  Represents a single row from a result that contains rows.

  Such a row consists of a number of fields, each storing single
  value. The number of fields and types of values stored in each
  field are described by `RowResult` instance that produced this
  row.

  Values of fields can be accessed with `get()` method or using
  `row[pos]` expression. Fields are identified by 0-based position.
  It is also possible to get raw bytes representing value of a
  given field with `getBytes()` method.

  @sa `Value` class.
  @todo Support for iterating over row fields with range-for loop.
